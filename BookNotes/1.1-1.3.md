# 1.1 What is the Internet?
## 1.1.1 A Nuts-and-Bolts Description
- End systems are connected together by a network of **communication links** and **packet switches**.
- Many types of communication links made up of physical media, including coaxial cable, copper wire, optical fiber, and radio spectrum.
- Different links can transmit data at different rates, with the **transmission rate** of a link measures in bits/second.
  
  When one end system has data to send to another end system, the sending end system segments the data and adds header bytes to each segment. The resulting packages of info, known as **packets**, are then sent through the network to the destination end system, where they are reassembled into the original data.
  
  A packet switch takes a packet arriving on one of its incoming communication links and forwards that packet on one of its outgoing communication links. The two most prominant types of packet switches are routers and link-layer switches. Both types of switches forward packets toward there ultimate destinations.
  
- Link-layer switches are typically used in access networks while routers are typically used in the network core.
- The sequence of communication links and packet switches traversed by a packet frin the sending end system to the recieving end system is know as a **route** or **path** through the network.
- In an analogy, packets are like trucks, communication links are like highways and roads, packet switches are like intersections, and end systems are like buildings. Just like a truck taking a path through the transportation network, a packet takes a path through a computer network.

- End systems access the internet through **Internet Service Providers (ISPs)**.
- End systems, packet switches, and other pieces of the internet run **protocols**. These control the sending and recieving of info within the internet.
- The **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)** and the **Internet Protocol (IP)** are two of the most important protocols.
- The **IP** specifies the format of the packets that are sent and recieved among routers and end systems.

When devloping protocols, its important that everyone agrees onw hat each one does so that people can create systems and products that work well together. This is where we get **standards**.
- **Internet standards**: Developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).
- The IETF standards documents are called **requests for comments (RFCs)**.
- **RFCs**: Define protocols such as TCP, IP, HTTP(web), and SMTP(email).
- **EXAMPLE:** Postal protocol for sending a letter. The rules are you must put the letter in an envelope, write info on it, and then put the letter into a mail box.

## 1.1.2 A Service Description
- **Distributed Applications**: Applications which involve multiple end systems exchanging data with one another.

How does one program running on one end system instruct the internet to deliver data to another program running on another end system?
- End systems attached to the internet provide a **socket interface** which specifies how a program running on one end system asks the internet infastructure to deliver data to a specific destination running on another end system.
- This internet socket interface is a set of ruls that a sending program must ollow so that the internet can deliver the data to the destination.

## 1.1.3 What is a Protocol?
**EXAMPLE:** In face to face human communication we have protocols. Such as if we are in class and are confused, we raise our hand (transmitting a message to the teacher), the teacher replies "yes" (a transmitted message meaning you can ask your question (transmitting your question to the teacher), the teacher then answers your question (transmitting this information back to you). Now this is a protocol and it is important that both end systems, in this case the student and the teacher, are running the same protocol. Say the student and teacher were running different protocols in this situation, say the teacher didn't know what a raised hand meant? Then this whole system would fall apart. It takes two (or more) communicating entities running the same protocol in order to accomplish a task.
