# 1.1 What is the Internet?
- End systems are connected together by a network of **communication links** and **packet switches**.
- Many types of communication links made up of physical media, including coaxial cable, copper wire, optical fiber, and radio spectrum.
- Different links can transmit data at different rates, with the **transmission rate** of a link measures in bits/second.
  
  When one end system has data to send to another end system, the sending end system segments the data and adds header bytes to each segment. The resulting packages of info, known as **packets**, are then sent through the network to the destination end system, where they are reassembled into the original data.
  
  A packet switch takes a packet arriving on one of its incoming communication links and forwards that packet on one of its outgoing communication links. The two most prominant types of packet switches are routers and link-layer switches. Both types of switches forward packets toward there ultimate destinations.
  
- Link-layer switches are typically used in access networks while routers are typically used in the network core.
- The sequence of communication links and packet switches traversed by a packet frin the sending end system to the recieving end system is know as a **route** or **path** through the network.
