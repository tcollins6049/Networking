# 2.2 The Web and HTTP

## 2.2.1 Overview of HTTP
- The **HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)**, the web's application-layer protocol, is implemented in two programs: a client program and a server program.
- The client and server programs on different end systems communicate with eachother by exchanging HTTP messages.
- HTTP defines the structure of these messages and how the client and server exchange these messages.

Some web terminology:
- A **Web Page** (Also called a document) consists of objects.
- An **Object** is a file, (such as an HTML file), that is addressable by a single URL.
- Most web pages consist of a **base HTML file** and several referenced objects.

- HTTP defines how web clients request web pages from web servers and how servers transfer web pages to clients.
- The word client here will reference a web browser.
- HTTP uses TCP as its underlying transport protocol (rather than UDP).
- The HTTP client first initiates a TCP connection with the server. Once that connection is established, the browser and the server processes access TCP through their socket interfaces.
- The socket is the door between the client process and the TCP connection on the client side.
- Since an HTTP server maintains no information about the clients, HTTP is said to be a **stateless protocol**.
