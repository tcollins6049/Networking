# 1.4 Delay, Loss, and Throughput in Packet-Switched Networks

## 1.4.1 Overview of Delay in Packet-Switched Network:
- Packet suffers from several types of delays at each node along its path from host to detination end system.
- The most important delays are **nodal processing delay, queuing delay, transmission delay, and propogation delay**.
- Together these delays accumulate a **total nodal delay**. 

### Processing Delay
- The time required to examine the packet's header and determine where to direct the packet.
### Queuing Delay
- The time a packet waits to be transmitted onto the link.
### Transmission Delay
- Denote the length of a packet to be L bits and denote the transmission rate from router A to B to be *R bits/sec*. The transmission rate would be *L/R*.
### Propogation Delay
- The time required to propogate fromt he beginning of the link to router B. The propogation depends on the physical medium of the link.


- Total delay given by Dnodal = Dproc + Dqueue + Dtrans + Dprop.
