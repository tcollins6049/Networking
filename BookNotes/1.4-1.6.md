# 1.4 Delay, Loss, and Throughput in Packet-Switched Networks

## 1.4.1 Overview of Delay in Packet-Switched Network:
- Packet suffers from several types of delays at each node along its path from host to detination end system.
- The most important delays are **nodal processing delay, queuing delay, transmission delay, and propogation delay**.
- Together these delays accumulate a **total nodal delay**. 

### Processing Delay
- The time required to examine the packet's header and determine where to direct the packet.
### Queuing Delay
- The time a packet waits to be transmitted onto the link.
