# 1.4 Delay, Loss, and Throughput in Packet-Switched Networks

## 1.4.1 Overview of Delay in Packet-Switched Network:
- Packet suffers from several types of delays at each node along its path from host to detination end system.
- The most important delays are **nodal processing delay, queuing delay, transmission delay, and propogation delay**.
- Together these delays accumulate a **total nodal delay**. 

### Processing Delay
- The time required to examine the packet's header and determine where to direct the packet.
### Queuing Delay
- The time a packet waits to be transmitted onto the link.
### Transmission Delay
- Denote the length of a packet to be L bits and denote the transmission rate from router A to B to be *R bits/sec*. The transmission rate would be *L/R*.
### Propogation Delay
- The time required to propogate fromt he beginning of the link to router B. The propogation depends on the physical medium of the link.


- Total delay given by Dnodal = Dproc + Dqueue + Dtrans + Dprop.


## 1.4.2 Queuing Delay and Packet Loss
- Let *a* denote the average rate at which packets arrive at the queue. *R* is the transmission rate, the rate at which bits are pushed out of the queue. Also, suppose that all packets are *L* bits. Then the average rate at which bits arrive at the queue is *La bits/sec*. The ratio *La/R* i called the **traffic intensity**. If *La/R > 1*, then the average rate at which bits arrive exceeds the rate at which bits can be transmitted from the queue therefore the queue will constantly increase in size.

### Packet Loss
- A queue has a finite capacity. If a packet arrives and there is no place to store the packet, the router will drop the packet. 

## 1.4.3 End-to-End Delay
- Suppose there are N - 1 routers between the source and destination host. Also suppose there is no queuing delay, the processing delay at each router and at the source host is *Dproc*, the transmission rate out of each router and out of the source host is *R bits/sec*, and the propogation on each link is *Dprop*.
- The nodal delays accumulate and give an end-to-end delay: *Dend-to-end = N (Dproc + Dtrans + Dprop)*. Where again, *Dtrans = L/R*.

### traceroute
- 2  j-cs-gw-int-10-240.cs.umass.edu (10.119.240.254) 1.296 ms 1.276 ms 1.245 ms
- column 1: *2 -- number of the router along the route*.
- column 2: *j-cs-gw-int-10-240.cs.umass.edu -- Name of the router*.
- column 3: *(10.119.240.254) -- Address of the router*.
- column 4, 5, 6: *1.296 ms 1.276 ms 1.245 ms -- round-trip delays for three experiments*
- If the source recieves fewer than three messages from any given router (due to packet loss), an asterisk is placed instead of a time in ms.

## 1.4.4 Throughput in Computer Networks
- Another critical performance measure in computer networks is end-to-end throughput.
- Consider transferring a large file from Host A to Host B. The **instantaneous throughput** at any instant of time is the rate *bits/sec* at which Host B is revieving the file. If the file consists of *F bits* and the transfer takes *T seconds* for Host B to recieve all F bits, then the **average throughput** of the file transfer is *F/T bits/sec*.


# 1.5 Protocol Layers and Their Service Models
## 1.5.1 Layered Architecture
- For large and complex systems that are constantly being updates, layering makes it so implementation within a layer can be changed without affecting other components of the overall system.

### Protocol Layering
- To provide structure to the design of network protocols, network designers organize protocols into **layers**.
- Each protocol belongs to a layer.
- A layer offers **services** to the layer above it, this is the **service model** of the layer.
- Each layer provides its service by (1) performing certain actions within that layer and by (2) using the services of the layer directly below it.
- When taken together, the protocols of the various layers are called the **protocol stack**. The internet protocol stack consists of five layers: *the physical, link, network, transport, and application layers*.
