# 2.3 Electronic Mail in the Internet
- An overview of the Internet mail system has three major components: **user agents**, **mail servers**, and the **Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)**.
- Example): Alice sends an email to Bob. The *User agent* allows users to read, reply to, forward, save, and compose messages. When Alice is finished composing her message, her user agent sends the message to her *mail server*, where the message is placed in the mail server's outgoing message queue. When Bob wants to read the message, his user agent retrieves the message from his mailbox in his mail server.
- Each recipient such as Bob has a **mailbox** located in one of the mail servers. The mailbox manages and maintains sent messages.
- SMTP is the principal application-layer protocol for Internet electronic mail. It uses TCP to transfer mail from the sender's mail server to the recipient's mail server.
- SMTP has two sides, a client side and a server side. When a mail server sends mail to other mail servers, it acts as an SMTP client. When the mail server recievs mail from other mail servers, it acts as an SMTP server.

## 2.3.1 SMTP
- SMTP restricts body of all mail messages to simple 7-bit ASCII.

## 2.3.2 Mail Message Formats
- A typical message header looks like this:
```
From: alice@crepes.fr
To: bob@hamburger.edu
Subject: Searching for the meaning of life.
```
